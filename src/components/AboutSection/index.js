          <AboutP>
            I'm currently in my last semester as a Computer Systems Technology student at the 
            British Columbia Institute of Technology. {'\n\n'}
            
            I just recently completed an 8-month co-op term at SAP, and have now started 
            working with Technovation as a Student Mentor; guiding girls aged 10-18 who are 
            in a coding competition. I have experience in the Agile Methodology, monitoring Jenkins 
            CI/CD builds and Object Oriented Programming within a large code-base. {'\n\n'}

            I'm always interested in new opportunities and challenges. Feel free to connect with me!
