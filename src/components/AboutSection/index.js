          <AboutP>
            I'm currently a third year Computer Science at Simon Fraser University (SFU), 
            with an interest in dev-ops, mobile development and data analysis. {'\n\n'}
            
            I recently completed an 8-month co-op term at SAP, as well as a Production Engineering Fellowship
            with Major League Hacking and Facebook, obtaining skills and learning new tools, such as AWS EC2 
            and Docker. I have experience with the Agile Methodology, monitoring Jenkins 
            CI/CD builds and Object Oriented Programming within a large code-base! {'\n\n'}

            I'm always interested in new opportunities and challenges. Feel free to connect with me!
